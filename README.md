<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h1>

<p>This repository contains the source code for a <strong>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</strong> developed as part of my web development internship at Prodigy Infotech. The game allows two players to compete against each other, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Two-Player Mode:</strong> Players take turns to mark their symbols on the grid.</li>
  <li><strong>Win Detection:</strong> The game checks for winning combinations and declares the winner.</li>
  <li><strong>Draw Detection:</strong> If the grid is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.</li>
  <li><strong>Restart Button:</strong> The game can be reset to start a new round.</li>
  <li><strong>Animations and Styling:</strong> Smooth animations and responsive design for an engaging user experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technology Stack:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML5</strong> for the structure</li>
  <li><strong>CSS3</strong> for styling and animations</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> for game logic and interactivity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This project is a mandatory task for my internship, focusing on developing interactive and dynamic web applications with clean and efficient code.</p>

<h2>How to Play:</h2>
